# Loan Qualifier CLI App

This project allows us to add a new feature enhancement to an existing lending software that allows an individual to see what loans they qualify for. Previously with this software, users were unable to save their qualifying loans to a CSV file to share. So, with this project, I have created a save functionality in order to allow the user to do just that. Now, they can now save and share their data.

## Technologies

The technologies used for this project include: Python Fire and Python Questionnary. 

Python Fire allows us to run and generate command line interfaces aka CLIs from any Python object and is the main tool in helping us run this program.

Python Questionary allows us to ask the user questions and save their inputs in order to run the program for their specific needs.
