# loan_qualifier_app
Added a feature to the current CLI to allow users to save their qualifying loans to a CSV file should they have any.

Should the user have any qualifying loans, the CLI will prompt the user with a question asking if they would like to save their loans as a CSV file.

If yes, the program will prompt the user for a save path, and notify the user once the files have been saved.

If no, the program will exit out and let the user know that they have chosen to not save their qualifying loans.

In the case that the user has no qualifying loans, the program will tell them that there are no loans to save and exit.
